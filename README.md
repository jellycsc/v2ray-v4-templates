# v2ray-v4-templates

Thanks [@veekxt](https://github.com/veekxt) for generously sharing these popular v2ray configuration templates. You should definitely checkout the [original repo](https://github.com/veekxt/v2ray-template) as well as his [web app](https://veekxt.com/utils/v2ray_gen) which makes customizing v2ray configuration file more easily.

This repo is changed to serve all the server-side v2ray configuration files for [ansible-v2ray](https://github.com/jellycsc/ansible-v2ray). Ansible is used for managing different v2ray configurations, and deploy them effortlessly in large scale.

I also wrote a little handy [Ansible role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/jellycsc/v2ray) for installing v2ray mainly on RHEL and Debian based OS. You should definitely check that out too:)
